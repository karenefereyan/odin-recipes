    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Skinless chicken breasts cutlets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock, or dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the chicken cutlets by slicing breast halves horizontally, butterflying them open. For pieces too thick, cut into halves. For pieces still too thick, flatten out with 
            kitchen hammer
        </li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, pepper and grated permesan. Rinse chicken pieces in water and dredge them in flour mixture until well coated</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and 2 tablespons of butter in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add half of chicken pieces, making sure not to crowd the pan. Brown well on each side, 
            about 3mins per side. Remove chicken from pan and reserve to a plate.  Cook the other breasts in the same manner, remove from pan. Place the breasts on a rack over a roasting
            pan and keep warm in a 225deg Fahrenheit oven while you prepare the sauce. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock or white wine, lemon juice, and carpers to the pan. Use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits. Reduce the sauce by half. </li>
        <li>Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespooons of butter.</li>
        <li>Plate the chicken and serve with the sauce poured over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley. </li>
    </ol>
