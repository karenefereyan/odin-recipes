    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. But as a Nigerian and on behalf of all other Nigerians, the best jollof rice is made in Nigeria. Take it or leave it. 
        The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomates, onions, spices, vegetables, and meat in a single pot. However, its method of cooking and prepartion differs
        across regions in Africa. But, I still stand my ground that Nigeria makes the best jollof rice.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups easy cook rice</li>
        <li>3 large red bell peppers</li>
        <li>1/2 can plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>Some scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>beef or chicken stock</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon curry and thyme powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon preferred seasoning</li>
        <li>3 knorr chicken cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white pepper</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Medium sized tomato for garnishing</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the rell bell peppers, tomatoes, scotch bonnet peppers and one onion into a smooth paste and set aside for use later.</li>
        <li>Add cookig oil to the pot, place on medium heat and add half sliced onions into the pot and fry till fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add blended pepper mix, tomato paste, knorr cubes, one teaspoon white pepper, bay leaves, into pot and cover to let fry till oil begins to float on top. This
            should take about 15-20mins.
        </li>
        <li>Wash rice thoroughly to rid it of starch and set aside. If you choose to parboil, do for just a few mins as the rice should still be preety strong. </li>
        <li>When the oil starts to float on top of the pepper mix, add the chicken/beef broth, cover and let cook for another 8-10mins. </li>
        <li>Add washed rice to the right amount of stew and combine thoroughly, ensuring the stew is only about 1cm above the rice when combined. When stew and rice are 
            fully combined, add in the butter, along with the minced garlic,  some white pepper and combine even more thoroughly. 
        </li>
        <li>Cover the rice and let it cook until rice softens. Stir occassionally with a wooden spoon to prevent clumps and the rice breaking up. </li>
        <li>Add little bits of water and/or stock as the need arises. Jollof rice needs steam not water to cook. So, add in little water but allow it to burn a little to give it
            the jollof smoky rice feel and allow the heat to be well trapped and help in cooking it faster and better. 
        </li>
        <li>When rice is properly cooked and good enough, add in the onion rings and/or sliced tomato and stir.  Combine thoroughly and leave for 1-2mins to get steam with the 
            residual heat left on the cooker. 
        </li>
        <li>Your delicious jollof rice is now here! Enjoy!!!</li>
